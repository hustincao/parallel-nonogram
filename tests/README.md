Each test contains two files: constraints and solution.

The constraint file gives all of the constraints for each test.
The first line gives the size of the board. Each line afterwards gives the constraint for each row and column (ordered by row left to right and then columns top to bottom). If the board is n by n, then the first line is "n n" and there will be n + n lines afterwards of constraints.

The solution file represents the solution of the board in binary (1 is colored, 0 is empty).
